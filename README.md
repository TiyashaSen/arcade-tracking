# ArcadeTokenSystem #

## Purpose:

The goal of this exercise is to create a token system for an arcade, which allows a user to purchase and spend tokens. Each transaction should be tracked in a ledger for historical purposes.
Create a simple UI and ledger system that records the token balance for a single customer and provides a detailed history of transactions.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.0.

## Production setup: 

The application is deployed in the following link and is working in the following environment:
https://arcade-token-tracking-system.herokuapp.com/

## Development server

Local setup: Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Steps to run in local:

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
